### 2. Project goals
- Building a **deep neural network** using **TensorFlow**  & **Transfer Learning** to classify dogs and cats images.

- Making a **Flask application** so user can upload their photos and receive the prediction.

### 3. Project plan

During this project, we tackled these steps:

**A. Build the model**

    
**B. Build the Flask app**

**Front end**
- HTML
    - How to connect frontend to backend
    - How to draw a number on HTML
    - How to make UI looks good

**Back end**
- Flask
    - How to set up Flask
    - How to handle backend error
    - How to make real-time prediction
    - Combine the model with the app
